# Privacy Policy for TV Sleep Timer

**Last Updated: December 27, 2025**

Kamil Christ ("we," "us," or "our") operates the TV Sleep Timer mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

## 1. Information Collection and Use
**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.**

The TV Sleep Timer app is designed with privacy as a priority. It does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personal data.

## 2. Accessibility Service API Usage
Our app uses the AccessibilityService API. This is a technical requirement for the app's core functionality.

*   **Why we use it**: To detect when the user presses the "RED" button on their remote control.
*   **What we do with it**: We only listen for that specific key event to toggle the sleep timer.
*   **Data Collection**: We **DO NOT** collect, record, or transmit any data via the Accessibility Service. We do not read screen content, track other app usage, or log keystrokes.
*   **Necessary for Functionality**: Without this service, the app would not be able to detect the button press while other apps (like Netflix or YouTube) are active.

## 3. WRITE_SETTINGS Permission
The app requests the `WRITE_SETTINGS` permission.
*   **Why we use it**: To temporarily change the system screen timeout to trigger a "sleep" action (screen off).
*   **Restore**: The app restores your original timeout settings once the TV wakes up.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking libraries.

## 5. Security of Data
As no data is collected, there is no risk of data breach or unauthorized access to your personal information through this app.

## 6. Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
